//! # P2: Optimizing image algorithms
//!
//! This file provides an `Image` data structure for representing grayscale 2D images.
//! This file also provides an implementation of a seam carving algorithm. Seam carving
//! is a form of content-aware resizing, i.e. it lets you make an image smaller without
//! distorting or cropping important content. I would recommend reading the "Process" section
//! of the Wikipedia article to understand the basics of the algorithm:
//!
//! <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving>
//!
//! You can see the algorithm in action by running it on one of the provided images:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --bin p2_img_bin --release -- castle.jpg 50
//! open output.jpg
//! ```
//!
//! However, the implementation provided is very slow for large images. You can see this
//! by running it on a 4k image:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --bin p2_img_bin --release -- landscape.jpg 5
//! ```
//!
//! In this problem, you will optimize the performance of the seam carving algorithm,
//! and thereby learn about the performance characteristics of Rust's data structures.
//!
//!
//! ## P2a: Read a profile
//!
//! Performance optimization always starts with profiling! So your first task is to generate a
//! profile of this algorithm, and then figure out which functions are taking the longest.
//!
//! Profiling tools are different for each operating system. I'll explain how to profile on Mac
//! and Linux. If you're on Windows, I would use the Linux instructions via WSL.
//!
//! ### Mac
//! You're going to use the Instruments application. First, download Xcode if you haven't already.
//! Then run:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo install cargo-instruments
//! ```
//!
//! Then generate a profile by running:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo instruments --release --bin p2_img_bin -t time -- vaporwave.jpeg 50
//! ```
//!
//! This will open an Instruments window. On the bottom right it will give a view on the "Heaviest Stack Trace".
//! Click the entry that says `week3::p2_img::Image::carve`, and start exploring!
//!
//! ### Linux
//! You're going to use a Flamegraph. First, follow the installation instructions on the `flamegraph` crate:
//! <https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph#installation>
//!
//! Then generate a flamegraph by running:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo flamegraph --bin p2_img_bin -- vaporwave.jpeg 50
//! ```
//!
//! This will generate a file `flamegraph.svg`. Open that file in your browser, and start exploring!
//!
//! ## P2b: Optimize the code
//!
//! Next, your goal is to use your insights from the profile to optimize the algorithm's implementation.
//! The reference solution is between 30-60x faster than the starter code, tested on an M1 Macbook Pro and
//! a Google Cloud x86 VM.
//!
//! You can optimize the code however you want. I recommend starting with the most expensive functions identified in the profile. Some considerations:
//! * **Redundant computation:** are any values being computed more often than they need to be? Can you just compute them once?
//! * **Unnecessary allocation:** is memory being allocated repeatedly? Could you allocate that memory up-front, or not at all?
//!   Note that many Rust data structures have constructor functions that specify an initial capacity.
//! * **Abstraction tax:** is the compiler missing optimization opportunities by the use of abstractions?
//!   Can you write more specialized code to reveal those opportunities?
//!
//! To statistically test whether your optimizations actually impact performance, you can use the provided benchmark suite by running:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo bench
//! ```
//!
//! The three provided images (`castle`, `vaporwave`, `landscape`) are used to benchmark seam carving on images of increasing resolution.
//! These benchmarks use the [Criterion](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/index.html) library to repeatedly sample
//! a function's performance, and then compute statistics on whether its performance changes.
//!
//! Note that some benchmarks will take a long time to run initially --- you can run a specificy benchmark by passing the `BENCH`
//! environment variable, e.g.
//!
//! ```bash
//! BENCH=castle cargo bench
//! ```
